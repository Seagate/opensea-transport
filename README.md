### The opensea libraries

**opensea-common**      - Operating System common operations, not specific to
                      storage standards. Contains functions and defines that
                      are useful to all other libraries.

**opensea-transport**   - Contains standard ATA/SCSI/NVMe functions based on open
                      standards for these command sets.  This layer also
                      supports different transporting these commands through
                      operating systems to the storage devices. Code depends on
                      opensea-common.

**opensea-operations**  - Contains common use cases for operations to be performed
                      on a storage device. This layer encapsulates the nuances
                      of each command set (ATA/SCSI) and operating systems
                      (Linux/Windows etc.) Depends on opensea-common and
                      opensea-transport.
