# Building opensea-operations

Building opensea-operations is similar to the other opensea-libraries and similar to the build process for openSeaChest or the opensea-api.

Please review the [BUILDING.md](https://github.com/Seagate/openSeaChest/blob/develop/BUILDING.md) from the openSeaChest project for more information.
